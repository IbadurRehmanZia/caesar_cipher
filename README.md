# Caesar Cipher 🔐  

This project is part of my **100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp** by *Angela Yu*.  
Although inspired by the course, I implemented the **cipher logic using my own approach**, not the one explained in the course.

## 📖 Project Overview  

The **Caesar Cipher** is a classical encryption technique where each letter in a message is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.  

This program is an **interactive command-line tool** that:  
- Asks the user for a message 📝  
- Asks for a shift number 🔢  
- Asks whether they want to **encode (encrypt)** or **decode (decrypt)** 🔄  
- Then returns the transformed message

## 🚀 Features  

- Interactive **encode/decode** system  
- User-defined **shift amount**  
- Works with both **uppercase and lowercase letters**  
- Keeps numbers, spaces, and special characters unchanged  
- Custom Caesar Cipher logic (my own implementation)
